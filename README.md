# Interestify
Android App for a campus System
Interestify, a project done in partial fulfillment of
the course Software Development for Portable Devices, provides
a platform to connect people with similar interests and to notify
like-minded people about events that they might care about so
as to reduce the group spamming that happens due to mass
messages. We developed an Android App using Android Studio
and used Firebase Realtime Database as the backend database.
Using database queries at multiple levels the app connects people
who might not even know each other but just share a common
interest.
